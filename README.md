- Adjustable grid size and obstacles  
- Real-time algorithm execution  

## 🔍 Algorithms Used  
This project implements the following pathfinding algorithms:  

- **A* Algorithm**: An informed search algorithm that combines the cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to the goal (heuristic) for optimal efficiency.  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: A weighted graph traversal algorithm that guarantees the shortest path by exploring all possible routes.  

## 🛠 Usage  
- Select an algorithm from the UI.   
- draw walls to create obstacles.  
- Click "Start" to visualize the pathfinding process.  

## 📌 Future Improvements
